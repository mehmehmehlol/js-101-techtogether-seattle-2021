# Intro to JavaScript by Megan Lo
Intro to JavaScript (for TechTogether Seattle 2021)

<b>Prerequsite: Understood basic HTML/CSS</b>

## Introduction
Hi everyone! Welcome to "Intro to JavaScript"! Ideally, I would prefer the course to be an hour long, 'cause I have so much wisdom I would like to share!! But since we got only 30 min, I'll do my best to include the basics that you have to know. By the end of the course, I want you to feel confident about the basic of JavaScipt, ready to step up your JS game and eventually incorporate JS in your website, or wherever you will use in the future!

I would also include post-workshop exercise and resources that I love in this repo. Feel free to clone this repo and add more stuff for yourself and use as a reference/refresher -- whatever works for you! :D 

## Contents
- Why I love JavaScript (a.k.a why is it so popular)? Where to include JS in HTML? -- demonstrate in code
- Syntax of JavaScript (create a repl to demonstrate that)
  - Object types -- numbers, strings, booleans, array; 
  - conditions -- if/else, for loops;
  - function;
  - show some Math method?
- String Template Literal
- Bonus: [to do list for me]: create a simple website -- counter -- demonstrate all the stuff above + querySelector, querySelectorAll, ElementById

Website Idea: A Passenger Counter with background change

## Post-workshop bonus exercise
- [ ] 1a. Function: Write a function to generate random background color (hint hint: make use of hex color)
- [ ] 1b. Try to figure out how to change the background color if you CLICK THE BUTTON
- [ ] 2a. HTML: First create a button 
- [ ] 2b. Array Manipulation: When you hit the button, the number displayed on the screen will PUSH to an array

Side Note: I would recommend to push the code regularly to Github if you are still new to Git.
