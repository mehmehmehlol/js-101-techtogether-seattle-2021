# Intro to JavaScript by Megan Lo
Intro to JavaScript (for TechTogether Seattle 2021)
<br/>
<b>Prerequsite: Understood basic HTML/CSS</b>

## Introduction
Hi everyone! Welcome to "Intro to JavaScript"! Ideally, I would prefer the course to be an hour long, 'cause I have so much wisdom I would like to share!! But since we got only 30 min, I'll do my best to include the basics that you have to know. By the end of the course, I want you to feel confident about the basic of JavaScipt, ready to step up your JS game and eventually incorporate JS in your website, or wherever you will use in the future!

I would also include post-workshop exercise and resources that I love in this repo. Feel free to clone this repo and add more stuff for yourself and use as a reference/refresher -- whatever works for you! :D 

## Contents
- Why I love JavaScript (a.k.a why is it so popular)? Where to include JS in HTML?
- Quick Demo on how HTML and JavaScript work together (Website Idea: A Passenger Counter with background change) <br/>
‚ú® Disclaimer: Code Reference from [Scrimba's Learn JavaScript For Free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript)

- Syntax of JavaScript
  - <code>console.log</code> the output
  - Data types -- numbers, strings, booleans, array...; 
  - Variable Declaration
  - conditions -- <code>if/else</code>, <code>if/else if/else</code>, <code>for</code> loops;
  - function;
  - show some Math method?
  - String Template Literal
  - Event Listener

- Bonus: [to do list for me]: create a simple website -- counter -- demonstrate all the stuff above + querySelector, querySelectorAll, ElementById


## Post-workshop bonus exercise

Let's finish our story, shall we?

Side Note: I would recommend to push the code to the repo regularly especially if you are still new to Git so that you can get used to the <code>git</code> command. <br/>
üëâüèª [Slides From Maryam's Intro to Github](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d9IXs8fQDumiahEs-fzCiGaOyj_io0-m/edit#slide=id.p5) 

- [ ] 1a. HTML: Create an <code>Increment</code> button 
- [ ] 1b: Function: Create a function to increment the count<br/><br/>

- [ ] 2a. HTML: Create a <code>Save</code> button
- [ ] 2b. Function: Create a function to display all the saved numbers (In this format: <code>3 - 4 - 1</code> etc.)
- [ ] 2c. (Bonus) Function + Array Manipulation + for loops: We want to see how many trees left by the end of the day. Make use of for loops and array to help you acheive that. (I am sure there's a better way, but this is a practice on array manipulation.) When you hit the button, the number displayed on the screen will PUSH to an array.<br/><br/>

- [ ] 3. (did not cover this in the workshop) Google what <code>Event Listener</code> is and understand what it is.
- [ ] 3a. HTML: Create a <code>Change Background Color</code> button
- [ ] 3b. Function: Write a function to generate random background color (hint hint: make use of hex color)
- [ ] 3c. HTML + JS: Inside that button, think about how you can make use one of the <code>Event Listeners</code> to change the background color when you <strong>CLICK</strong> the button.<br/><br/>
