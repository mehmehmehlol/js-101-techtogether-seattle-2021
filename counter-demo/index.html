<!-- Backstory:
You are the Christmas Tree Farm manager/Software Engineer -- super busy person. You have to manage the farm by
counting how many Christmas trees that are left with the counter app that YOU built. The initial count is 10. (We have a small farm, alright? ðŸ˜­ don't judge, please.) The Christmas Tree Farm also has an extremely generous return policy
that people can return Christmas tree. -->
